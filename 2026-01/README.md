# 2026-01: Playground Series S6E1 - Predicting Student Test Scores

## 📋 Challenge Overview

**Kaggle Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e1

**Objective**: Predict student test scores based on available features

**Dataset**: 
- Training set: [number of rows] samples with [number of features] features
- Test set: [number of rows] samples
- Target variable: `test_score`

**Evaluation Metric**: [RMSE/MAE/Accuracy - as per competition]

## 🎯 Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [ ] Load and inspect data
- [ ] Check for missing values
- [ ] Analyze feature distributions
- [ ] Identify correlations with target
- [ ] Detect outliers

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Handle missing values
- [ ] Encode categorical variables
- [ ] Scale/normalize features
- [ ] Remove/engineer features

### 3. Feature Engineering
- [ ] Create interaction features
- [ ] Polynomial features
- [ ] Domain-specific features
- [ ] Feature selection

### 4. Model Development
- [ ] Baseline model
- [ ] Try multiple algorithms
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Cross-validation

### 5. Ensemble & Optimization
- [ ] Combine models
- [ ] Final hyperparameter optimization
- [ ] Generate predictions

## 📊 Results

**Best Model**: [Model name and score]
**Cross-Validation Score**: [Score]
**Test Submission Score**: [Score]

### Performance Progression
| Attempt | Approach | Score | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Baseline | - | Initial submission |
| 2 | [Improvement] | - | [Notes] |
